In April 1985, the idea for a Caribbean Club was concieved and acted upon by a few dedicated students, who spent many days trying to solicit enough signatures to officially activate the organization. The Caribbean Club, as it was called, served as a ""home away from home"" for the many Caribbean students at UCF. The club was formed with the purpose of fostering a cultural bridge between the Caribbean and the United States.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">In the Spring of 1990, the club was reactivated. It was tough in the beginning, but the hardwork and persistence finally paid off in the Spring of 1992 when the <strong><span style=""color: #008000;"">Caribbean</span> <span style=""color: #ffcc00;""> Students'</span><span style=""color: #ff0000;""> Association</span></strong> was officially formed and the membership blossomed from 15 to 100 members. The hard work and persistence finally paid off.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">&nbsp;The Club meetings provide a relaxed atmosphere for students to meet and network. Students of all cultures were encouraged to share their Caribbean heritage while keeping the <em>traditions of their Caribbean ancesto</em>rs. Today, our membership has increased to over 300 students. <em>Dedicated members</em> are the key to the success of CSA.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">In 1992 our Association at UCF became one of the five educational institutions that started the Florida Caribbean Students' Association and is one of the initial five organizations at UCF to become apart of the university's MultiCultural Student Center.</p>

Christians on Campus has many chapters on many campuses throughout the nation but does not take direction from any central headquarters or organization. Instead, the members practice to fellowship with other clubs from the various campuses in semesterly gatherings and yearly conferences. Through the decades of the Christians on Campus ministry, many graduates are kept connected to the students from the campus where they graduated, and are easily plugged into another campus should they move to a new city for work or graduate school. These alumni are very useful in mentoring new students due to their previous experiences as students and their current professional development.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Our goals are threefold:</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Our first goal is to cause the students to see how critical these college years are for their own pursuit of Christ, their education, and for their development in spirit, soul, and body. In addition, the club desires to produce many mentors who could carry on the care for the younger, incoming students coming to UCF.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Secondly, our goal is to connect students with each other and with local Christian families and alumni throughout Central Florida and beyond to support the students in their spiritual condition, mental health, and academics.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Finally, to equip all the students in the realization of the divine truths according to the Scriptures (2 Timothy 3:16-17, 1 Timothy 2:4, 2 Peter 3:18), and for each one to realize the application of the Scripture in their daily living.</span></p>",Our primary mission is to bridge students into the homes of alumni and families around UCF and link students with over 80 registered student organizations across the nation to foster life-long companionships with other college-aged Christians nationwide.,['Religious/Spiritual']

<p>The Future Technical Communicators (FTC) student organization here at UCF is dedicated to helping students pursue careers in technical communication. What exactly does that mean? We work together to master the skills we will need once we graduate to create any kind of documentation for technical processes. That can mean everything from writing instructions to designing user-friendly websites.&nbsp;This organization is primarily intended for students who are interested in pursuing careers in the technical communication field, although membership is open to students from all majors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even if you are not familiar with the profession, technical communication might be the field for you!&nbsp;Do you have skills in any of these areas?</p>
<p>* Core skills in writing and editing</p>
<p>* Creative page design</p>
<p>* Photography and videography</p>
<p>* Technical illustration</p>
<p>* International communication</p>
<p>* Training and education</p>
<p>* Web and IT skills</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technical communicators serve as the bridge between technology and the outside world. We take complex information and make accessible and exciting!&nbsp;Technical communication spans many disciplines and the job market is huge. Unless technology stands still, it will always be a growth market. Since companies are beginning to realize that poor writing and poor communication hurt their bottom line, solving that problem taps into your core skills.&nbsp;There are over 45,000 technical writers in the U.S. alone!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FTC can also help you gain experience by obtaining an internship and part-time&nbsp;opportunities.

<div>Since we are the ILEA Orlando student club, KSES members have the fantastic opportunity to become an ILEA Student Member. You can be an ILEA Student Member for all four years, and we highly recommend it for Juniors and Seniors; student membership, however, is open to everyone! The benefits of becoming a member are endless and include being able to attend ILEA meetings, being a full member of the national society, and networking- to name a few! KSES will also notify you of numerous volunteer opportunities with ILEA so you can gain experience, which is a critical aspect of being successful in the event industry. The typical annual ILEA membership cost is approximately $500, but as a Student Member with KSES, the price is significantly reduced to only $50! Being an ILEA student member is not a requirement for KSES, but we strongly encourage it as it will provide you with excellent opportunities and is great for your resume and future success.</div>","The mission of Knights Special Events Society is to provide members and stakeholders collaborative networking, education, professional development, inspiration and outward awareness, and credibility to ensure a thriving global creative events profession.",['Hospitality Management']

<p>In the spring of 1999, after many years of trials and tribulations, 15 outstanding ladies established the Beta Theta Chapter. This made it the 31st&nbsp;chapter of Lambda Theta Alpha, the first Latin organization in the nation. Its purpose is to cater towards the needs of women on the UCF campus.</p>
<p>Along with the accomplishment of the establishment of a chapter, the Founding Sisters of Beta Theta Chapter also established and fought for recognition of the Diversified Greek Council by the Greek community at UCF. This was a monumental accomplishment for Beta Theta chapter. Once the Diversified Greek Council was established and recognized, other multicultural Greek organizations were able to start a chapter on campus.</p>
<p>On November 4, 2000, Line One was added to Beta Theta. This group of ladies had realized a long-standing goal of theirs when they were welcomed into the Lambda Theta Alpha sisterhood. Eventually, eleven ladies succeeded and became what is known as &ldquo;The First Dynasty.&rdquo; From then on the legacy of Beta Theta continues to grow with high quality ladies that are determined to leave a mark on campus and in the community.</p>
<p>Through various community service projects and educational programming, Beta Theta is making a difference. We are determined to give back, not only UCF but, the Central Florida community. Whether it is telethons with Arnold Palmer Hospital to help raise money for the cancer wing, or giving out food to the homeless, our sisterhood strives to help those in need. Beta Theta also does workshops on issues that can affect everyone, such as self-defense, as well as enlighten others on people and various walks of life. It is our hope to break down barriers within our community and to dissipate ignorance. We strive to become leaders and inspire other women to stand up for their beliefs and never stop reaching for their dreams.</p>

<p>The Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) was founded in Los Angeles, California, in 1974 by a group of engineers employed by the city of Los Angeles. Their objective was to form a national organization of professional engineers to serve as role models in the Hispanic community. This organization made its way to Orlando in 1988.</p>
<p>Our Chapter focuses on the Hispanic population at the University of Central Florida. For our members, we offer workshops, discussion panels, information sessions, and much more to prepare our soon-to-be Engineers for the real world. Companies come to our Chapter to discuss a multitude of topics, such as how to write a winning resume, interviewing tips/techniques and what companies expect out of an entry-level Engineer.</p>
<p>SHPE National's mission is to empower the Hispanic community, so we took it upon our Chapter to engage with the younger community around Orlando to inform them about the importance of STEM. We conduct school visits to middle and high schools through our SHPE Junior Program to present what technical professions are and how they affect our everyday life. We also monitor student competitions for SECME, a statewide program that enables younger student with hands-on projects with basic math and science applications.</p>
<p>With almost 400 members, every day we're closer to reaching the entire Hispanic STEM community at the University of Central Florida. We are devoted to empowering our members to realize their fullest potential and to impact the world through STEM awareness, access, support, and development. Leadership is a key element for SHPE and we encourage all members to become leaders within our organization. It&rsquo;s not only a great experience, but it allows you meet other students and Chapters.</p>

<p class=""x_MsoNormal"">The Student Academic Resource Center (SARC) at the University of Central Florida, affectionately known for its iconic Red Door, has a rich history dating back to its founding by Dr. Mary Helen Callarman in 1988. Originally housed in a gray portable classroom, Dr. Callarman boldly painted its front door red over a weekend, a move that not only distinguished SARC but also symbolized its commitment to student support amidst a sea of uniformity.</p>
<p class=""x_MsoNormal"">From its inception, SARC has championed a student-centric approach, pioneering innovative academic support programs. Initially offering peer tutoring and the College Achievement Program, SARC has since expanded its services to include Supplemental Instruction (SI), group and one-on-one peer tutoring, academic consultations, academic success workshops, and online learning support. Over the past several decades, SARC has positively impacted students&rsquo; academic journeys over one million times.</p>
<p class=""x_MsoNormal"">In 2001, SARC relocated to Howard Phillips Hall, enhancing its accessibility and outreach. In 2018, it moved again to Trevor Colbourn Hall, UCF&rsquo;s newest building, further increasing its presence and capacity to serve the growing student body. Throughout each move, the original Red Door remains a cherished symbol, adorned with a plaque honoring Dr. Callarman&rsquo;s pioneering spirit and the enduring mission of SARC.</p>
