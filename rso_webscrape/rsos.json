In April 1985, the idea for a Caribbean Club was concieved and acted upon by a few dedicated students, who spent many days trying to solicit enough signatures to officially activate the organization. The Caribbean Club, as it was called, served as a \"home away from home\" for the many Caribbean students at UCF. The club was formed with the purpose of fostering a cultural bridge between the Caribbean and the United States.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">In the Spring of 1990, the club was reactivated. It was tough in the beginning, but the hardwork and persistence finally paid off in the Spring of 1992 when the <strong><span style=\"color: #008000;\">Caribbean</span> <span style=\"color: #ffcc00;\"> Students'</span><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"> Association</span></strong> was officially formed and the membership blossomed from 15 to 100 members. The hard work and persistence finally paid off.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;The Club meetings provide a relaxed atmosphere for students to meet and network. Students of all cultures were encouraged to share their Caribbean heritage while keeping the <em>traditions of their Caribbean ancesto</em>rs. Today, our membership has increased to over 300 students. <em>Dedicated members</em> are the key to the success of CSA.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">In 1992 our Association at UCF became one of the five educational institutions that started the Florida Caribbean Students' Association and is one of the initial five organizations at UCF to become apart of the university's MultiCultural Student Center.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Today, CSA is one of the <em>most active</em> Student Organizations on the University of Central Florida campus.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #008000;\">C</span><span style=\"color: #ffcc00;\">S</span><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">A</span> gives a special thanks to:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Las Adams, Elton Bracey, Victor Flores, Barry Brennen, Kisha Dunn, Tricia Phillip, Deanna Hoyen, Alfredo Barrett Jr., Patrice Phillip, Denise Green, Drumeco Lauritson, Gordan McKenzie, Jason Isree, Jey Singam, Yonette Forde, Sharon Cruz, Lisa Pitram, Andrea Brown.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Most of All:</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Raymond Permaul</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Lynette Permaul</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Jameer Abass</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Edmund Dabiedah</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>and</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Anne Marie de Govia</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Christians on Campus has many chapters on many campuses throughout the nation but does not take direction from any central headquarters or organization. Instead, the members practice to fellowship with other clubs from the various campuses in semesterly gatherings and yearly conferences. Through the decades of the Christians on Campus ministry, many graduates are kept connected to the students from the campus where they graduated, and are easily plugged into another campus should they move to a new city for work or graduate school. These alumni are very useful in mentoring new students due to their previous experiences as students and their current professional development.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our goals are threefold:</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our first goal is to cause the students to see how critical these college years are for their own pursuit of Christ, their education, and for their development in spirit, soul, and body. In addition, the club desires to produce many mentors who could carry on the care for the younger, incoming students coming to UCF.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Secondly, our goal is to connect students with each other and with local Christian families and alumni throughout Central Florida and beyond to support the students in their spiritual condition, mental health, and academics.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, to equip all the students in the realization of the divine truths according to the Scriptures (2 Timothy 3:16-17, 1 Timothy 2:4, 2 Peter 3:18), and for each one to realize the application of the Scripture in their daily living.</span></p>",

Each&nbsp;of our partner communities receives a brigade every 3 to 6 months where hundreds of patients are provided one on one consultations, public health workshops, and given the proper medication or referral. Electronic patient records are collected through Data Informatics to monitor overall community health trends. Between brigades our in-country team maintains relationships with the communities to provide follow-up care and education.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Volunteer brigade participation may vary based on the medical background and skill of the volunteer. Volunteers with little to no medical experience have the opportunity to assist during triage, shadow doctors during consultations, deliver educational workshops, and help pack medications under the supervision of a local pharmacist. All patient consultations as well as the prescribing of medications is done only by licensed doctors. Regardless of medical skill level, all volunteers contribute to the clinic. Furthermore, volunteers have the opportunity to learn about providing sustainable healthcare to rural communities who would otherwise have limited access.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>To become a member fill out the following:</strong></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://form.jotform.com/251405495897066\">https://form.jotform.com/251405495897066&nbsp;</a></p>",

This made it the 31st&nbsp;chapter of Lambda Theta Alpha, the first Latin organization in the nation. Its purpose is to cater towards the needs of women on the UCF campus.</p>\r\n<p>Along with the accomplishment of the establishment of a chapter, the Founding Sisters of Beta Theta Chapter also established and fought for recognition of the Diversified Greek Council by the Greek community at UCF. This was a monumental accomplishment for Beta Theta chapter. Once the Diversified Greek Council was established and recognized, other multicultural Greek organizations were able to start a chapter on campus.</p>\r\n<p>On November 4, 2000, Line One was added to Beta Theta. This group of ladies had realized a long-standing goal of theirs when they were welcomed into the Lambda Theta Alpha sisterhood. Eventually, eleven ladies succeeded and became what is known as &ldquo;The First Dynasty.&rdquo; From then on the legacy of Beta Theta continues to grow with high quality ladies that are determined to leave a mark on campus and in the community.</p>\r\n<p>Through various community service projects and educational programming, Beta Theta is making a difference. We are determined to give back, not only UCF but, the Central Florida community. Whether it is telethons with Arnold Palmer Hospital to help raise money for the cancer wing, or giving out food to the homeless, our sisterhood strives to help those in need. Beta Theta also does workshops on issues that can affect everyone, such as self-defense, as well as enlighten others on people and various walks of life. It is our hope to break down barriers within our community and to dissipate ignorance. We strive to become leaders and inspire other women to stand up for their beliefs and never stop reaching for their dreams.</p>\r\n<p align=\"left\"><strong>Mission:&nbsp;</strong>The purpose of Lambda Theta Alpha shall be to provide a sisterhood based on Unity, Love, and Respect.

By being engaged citizens, students not only make connections within the broader community, but also make connections within their respective student community.

            "Description": "<p>During the fall of 1989, the foundation of Sigma Lambda Gamma National Sorority, Inc. was commenced by collegiate women who recognized the need to form an organization that provided empowerment to women of all cultural backgrounds. Their humble beginnings were built at the University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa where their vision was to create a network of academic and social support for all women/nonbinary. Under the guidance of Esther Materon Arum and Mary Peterson, the vision came to fruition on April 9th, 1990, as the University of Iowa Panhellenic Council officially recognized the organization as a sorority.</p>\r\n<p>Through the continued commitment and leadership of the founding mothers, the operation of Sigma Lambda Gamma has thrived on many college campuses and provides an avenue for educational excellence to women of many nationalities. Our members recognize the need for togetherness and support among members of varying cultures at the university level and they remain dedicated to the overall success of members in a global environment.</p>\r\n<p>Sigma Lambda Gamma is a sisterhood/siblinghood of members who have chosen this affiliation as a manner to achieve personal development and awareness to the responsibility of community involvement for the betterment of our local, regional, national and global communities through the efforts of a network of close to 3,000 sorority members. Furthermore, we continue to be a pioneer in the Greek fraternal world through development of innovative programming initiatives, such as the Young Women&rsquo;s Leadership Program and Emotional Intelligence.</p>\r\n<p>Today, Sigma Lambda Gamma is the largest and fastest-growing multicultural sorority with a multicultural membership in chapters and alumnae associations throughout the United States &ndash; from Arizona to Wyoming; Florida to Minnesota; New York to Texas; and many more states between the coasts of California and Rhode Island. A criterion for membership into Sigma Lambda Gamma is open to members of exceptional morals &amp; ethics with a demonstrated commitment to academic excellence, and who are pursuing or have completed courses leading to a degree in an accredited college of university. Sigma Lambda Gamma is welcome to women, trans women, and nonbinary. Culture is Pride, Pride is Success.</p>",

Their objective was to form a national organization of professional engineers to serve as role models in the Hispanic community. This organization made its way to Orlando in 1988.</p>\r\n<p>Our Chapter focuses on the Hispanic population at the University of Central Florida. For our members, we offer workshops, discussion panels, information sessions, and much more to prepare our soon-to-be Engineers for the real world. Companies come to our Chapter to discuss a multitude of topics, such as how to write a winning resume, interviewing tips/techniques and what companies expect out of an entry-level Engineer.</p>\r\n<p>SHPE National's mission is to empower the Hispanic community, so we took it upon our Chapter to engage with the younger community around Orlando to inform them about the importance of STEM. We conduct school visits to middle and high schools through our SHPE Junior Program to present what technical professions are and how they affect our everyday life. We also monitor student competitions for SECME, a statewide program that enables younger student with hands-on projects with basic math and science applications.</p>\r\n<p>With almost 400 members, every day we're closer to reaching the entire Hispanic STEM community at the University of Central Florida. We are devoted to empowering our members to realize their fullest potential and to impact the world through STEM awareness, access, support, and development. Leadership is a key element for SHPE and we encourage all members to become leaders within our organization. It&rsquo;s not only a great experience, but it allows you meet other students and Chapters.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SHPE UCF: En la Florida Central, &iexcl;Juntos sin parar!</p>\r\n<p>Register with us to become a member: <a href=\"https://form.jotform.com/70387424224151\"> Membership Registration Form</a></p>\r\n<p>Make sure to connect with us on our socials:</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://discord.gg/K5fXQJbR\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Discord</a> | <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/shpeucf/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram</a> | <a href=\"https://shpeucf.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Website</a> | <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/shpe-ucf/posts/?feedView=all\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> LinkedIn</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Through collaboration and partnerships with internal and external constituencies, the center will remain cutting-edge in facilitating service to students by providing opportunities for a smooth, seamless, and successful transition to UCF and progress toward graduation.</p>\r\n<h2>Goals</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>To develop and implement quality academic support services for UCF students.</li>\r\n<li>Establish partnerships and provide outreach programming that will contribute to the academic success and persistence of UCF students.</li>\r\n<li>Enhance learning in and outside of the classroom.</li>\r\n<li>Enhance learning for UCF students with comprehensive and innovative learning initiatives.</li>\r\n<li>Provide excellent customer service to UCF students who use SARC services and programs.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">The Student Academic Resource Center (SARC) at the University of Central Florida, affectionately known for its iconic Red Door, has a rich history dating back to its founding by Dr. Mary Helen Callarman in 1988. Originally housed in a gray portable classroom, Dr. Callarman boldly painted its front door red over a weekend, a move that not only distinguished SARC but also symbolized its commitment to student support amidst a sea of uniformity.</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">From its inception, SARC has championed a student-centric approach, pioneering innovative academic support programs. Initially offering peer tutoring and the College Achievement Program, SARC has since expanded its services to include Supplemental Instruction (SI), group and one-on-one peer tutoring, academic consultations, academic success workshops, and online learning support. Over the past several decades, SARC has positively impacted students&rsquo; academic journeys over one million times.</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">In 2001, SARC relocated to Howard Phillips Hall, enhancing its accessibility and outreach. In 2018, it moved again to Trevor Colbourn Hall, UCF&rsquo;s newest building, further increasing its presence and capacity to serve the growing student body. Throughout each move, the original Red Door remains a cherished symbol, adorned with a plaque honoring Dr. Callarman&rsquo;s pioneering spirit and the enduring mission of SARC.</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Discover more about SARC&rsquo;s legacy of academic excellence and student empowerment through its vibrant history and ongoing commitment to student success.</p>\r\n<h2>Accessibility Statement</h2>\r\n<p>The Student Academic Resource Center is committed to ensuring all web resources are usable by everyone.
